    "This notebook takes data from WIAG as the primary source and joins it with data from FactGrid to find out which institutions, roles or institution roles need to be added to FactGrid. After generating files for adding these things to FactGrid (institutions are now instead added using the workflow developed for [DomVoc](https://github.com/Germania-Sacra/DomVoc/tree/main)), at the end a file for adding all offices of persons to FactGrid is generated.\n",

This enables you to go through the notebook linearly from start to finish and add all four things for the majority of entries right away. This means though, that you will need to go through the notebook multiple (up to four) times to make sure FactGrid is all up-to-date.\n",
